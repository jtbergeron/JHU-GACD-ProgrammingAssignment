----------

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:<br>
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.<br>
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. <br>
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. <br>
- Its activity label. <br>
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. <br>

# Source Data Defined - Looking at the files

##There are 4 sets of files:

1.  Informational about the data and files contained:
	1.  **README.txt** - information about the files.
	2.  **features_info.txt** - information about the features (measures). 
<br>          
2.  There are two files that translate/describe the data in the other two sets:
	1.  **features.txt** - 561 names associated with 561 features/measures.
	2.  **activity_labels.txt** - 6 names associated with the activity codes.
<br>
3.  The **Test dataset**, consisting of 3 files, each with an equal number of records:
	1.  **X_test.txt** - Each record has a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
	2.  **subject_test.txt** - Each record has a numeric code identifying the test subject (person).
	3.  **y_test.txt** - Each record has a code associated with the activity (maps to activity_labels.txt).
<br>
4.  The **Train dataset**, consisting of 3 files, each with an equal number of records:
	1.  **X_train.txt** - Each record has a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
	2.  **subject_train.txt** - Each record has a numeric code identifying the test subject (person).
	3.  **y_train.txt** - Each record has a code associated with the activity (maps to activity_labels.txt).
